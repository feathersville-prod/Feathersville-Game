 "Feathersville - A Life of Love and Loss: A visual novel developed by Feathersville Productions."
Feathersville - A Life of Love and Loss is a heartfelt visual novel by Feathersville Productions, founded by Bee (formerly Nat), a passionate writer and game designer from Boise. Inspired by Our Life: Beginnings and Always, this game dives deep into the emotional journey of growing up, love, and loss, following characters through their intertwined lives across several years.


About the Game- 
Feathersville - A Life of Love and Loss is a narrative-driven visual novel that focuses on emotionally complex characters and their evolving relationships. Set in the quiet, snowy town of Feathersville, players follow the protagonist (a customizable character) as they navigate friendships, family dynamics, and romance, all while coping with life-altering events like love and grief.

The game unfolds over several years, starting from childhood and progressing through adolescence, allowing the player to make choices that impact the story and relationships.

Gameplay Features-
Character Customization: Customize the protagonist’s name, gender, appearance, and personality. You can play as a boy, girl, or non-binary character, with various customization options for hair, eyes, stature, and more.

Interactive Storytelling: Your choices impact relationships, with multiple romance and friendship paths. The primary characters, Linden and Chase, have distinct romantic arcs, but you can choose whether the relationships remain romantic, platonic, or casual.

Branching Narrative: The game features a rich narrative with multiple endings and outcomes based on your decisions, allowing for replayability and diverse player experiences.

Emotional Depth: The story deals with complex themes like loss, heartache, and coming-of-age. The player will experience life’s highs and lows, from the joy of new relationships to the sorrow of losing loved ones.

Characters-
Linden Griffith: A shy, fragile boy with a heart condition. As the years pass, his health deteriorates, and players can choose how to support him through his struggles. Linden is one of the key love interests and offers a deeply emotional, heart-wrenching storyline.

Chase Avery: An adventurous and competitive skier, Chase offers a different type of relationship, filled with playful banter and light-hearted moments. Players can engage in a more casual or flirtatious dynamic with Chase.

Other Characters:
Jack Griffith: Linden’s sibling, who plays a key supporting role throughout the story.

Peony, Kavya, Elliot, Sammi, and Lila: A close-knit group of friends and family with their own subplots, contributing to the larger narrative.

Project Status-
Currently, the game's plot, character arcs, and major narrative decisions are fully outlined. The game is being developed in Ren'Py, but we need help with additional development tasks, especially in coding and artwork.


The project is in an active development phase, but as a passion project, we are seeking volunteers to help bring this game to life.

Contributing-
We are currently seeking volunteers to assist with:

Game Developers (Ren'Py): To help implement the existing scripts and game logic.

Character Artists: To create sprites for each character, featuring various emotions and ages.

Background Artists: To design detailed, anime-style backgrounds for the wintery town of Feathersville.

Unfortunately, we cannot offer payment at this time, but all contributors will be fully credited and linked in the final release of the game.
